# Fetch Github repos

Given a list of Github usernames, fetch .zip versions of all their public repos and put them in a local folder.

## How to use it

1. Open the Terminal on your computer.
2. Type in `git clone https://github.com/sjmog/get_git_repos`.
3. Type in `cd get_git_repos`.
4. Type `./fetch <usernames of who to fetch>`. For example: `./fetch sjmog neoeno` would fetch all the public repos for sjmog (me!) and neoeno (Kay).

Once you're done, type `open .` to see folders for all the developers, containing all their repos in .zip format.

## It's broken :(

Let me know if you have issues. This script is very hacky!
